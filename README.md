# What is this?
> ### BeReal, for Spotify.
<br>

This is a full-stack web app aiming to replicate some of BeReal's functionality, applying it towards Spotify player status instead.

It uses the **Spotify API**, **MongoDB**, the **Push API**, and **Node**.

# Why?

It's meant as a group project for Hyland's Tech Outreach program, in particular the Capstone course. It serves as a learning experience for full-stack development, group collaboration, and GitHub branching.
